# Piano --> Guitar Eat Trainer Browser App

Browser application written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that allows the user to click a note on the piano in any octave and hear the corresponding note from the guitar. 

Additional features include guitar fretboard note memorization game and circle of fifths memorization game. 

Idea is to improve ear training and music theory knowledge.
